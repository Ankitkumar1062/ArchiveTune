/**
 * CompositionLocal that signals to descendant components (notably the custom
 * [IconButton]) that they are being rendered inside a `plain = true`
 * [FrostedHeaderPill]. When `true`, the custom [IconButton] overrides its
 * default `IconButtonColors` to use a transparent `containerColor` so no
 * circular background is drawn behind the icon — matching the user's
 * explicit request (2026-08-29): "There's still frosted header pills in
 * settings and it's submenus. Remove it." Even with `FrostedHeaderPill(
 * plain = true)`, the wrapping Row alone didn't remove the visual pill
 * appearance because the inner [IconButton] component still rendered a
 * `CircleShape`-clipped `containerColor` background, which read as a
 * circular "pill" behind the back arrow. This CompositionLocal lets the
 * IconButton self-detect the plain-header context and switch to a fully
 * transparent container without requiring every call site to explicitly
 * pass `colors = IconButtonDefaults.iconButtonColors(containerColor =
 * Color.Transparent)`.

/**
 * A frosted-glass-looking pill that wraps header content (title text, icon buttons) so the
 * header can be transparent while the content inside it stays legible against any background.
 *
 * The pill renders as a semi-transparent `surfaceContainer` surface. Earlier iterations tried to
 * composite a real backdrop blur over [LocalNavigationBarBackdrop], but the pill lives
 * INSIDE the NavHost content that is recorded into that same backdrop layer every frame
 * (`drawWithContent` in `MainActivity`), so drawing `backdrop.layer` from inside the pill is
 * re-entrant and crashes the app — both the S+ `drawLayer` path and the pre-S bitmap capture
 * read a layer that is currently being recorded. Degrading to a plain surface is the same
 * fallback those paths already used when no backdrop was available, and matches how the pill
 * behaves in rail layouts where the backdrop is null.
 *
 * The fallback deliberately uses a dense frosted material rather than a nearly transparent
 * surface. Settings pages cannot safely sample the app-wide backdrop from inside the NavHost,
 * but their controls must still read as a visible glass surface instead of an empty pill.
 *
 * **Liquid glass mode:** Pass a non-null [backdrop] (typically created via [rememberBackdrop]
 * and applied to a sibling `LazyColumn` via [Modifier.layerBackdrop]) to switch the pill to
 * real kyant `drawBackdrop` rendering (vibrancy + blur + lens). The pill MUST be a sibling
 * of the composable carrying `layerBackdrop` — nesting it inside the source creates a
 * render-feedback loop that crashes the RuntimeShader. When [backdrop] is `null` (the
 * default), the pill degrades to the translucent `surfaceContainer` surface described above.
 *
 * **Plain mode (Settings + submenus):** Pass [plain] = `true` to skip the Surface / clip /
 * border entirely and just render the content in a `Row` with the same padding as the
 * pill path. The user explicitly requested "remove all the liquid glass from settings
 * and its submenus Page" — so Settings pages render a plain Material3 TopAppBar look
 * (just the back button + title inline) without any frosted pill chrome. The `plain`
 * flag is opt-in so that other callers (History, Library chrome, Apple Music-style
 * playlist pills) keep their frosted surface.
 *
 * Usage: wrap the title / actions of a `TopAppBar` (or any header) in this pill. The
 * outer `TopAppBar` should have `containerColor = Color.Transparent`.
 *
 * @param modifier Modifier for the pill's outer layout.
 * @param backdrop Optional kyant `LayerBackdrop` to sample for real liquid glass.
 *                 Pass `null` (default) to use the translucent surface fallback.
 * @param plain When `true`, skip the Surface/clip/border entirely and render the
 *              content in a plain `Row` with the same internal padding. Use this on
 *              Settings screens where the user wants zero glass chrome.
 * @param content The header content (text, icons) to display inside the pill.
